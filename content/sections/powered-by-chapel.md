Arkouda's backend is implemented in [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org), an
open-source parallel programming language. Chapel is unique among mainstream
languages as it puts parallelism and locality in the forefront, while not
sacrificing productivity or portability.  Chapel enables Arkouda to perform well
and scale on many different architectures, from multicore laptops to cloud
systems to world's fastest supercomputers.

To learn more about Chapel, check out [its
blog](https://chapel-lang.org/blog/index.html), [presentations, tutorials and
demos](https://www.youtube.com/@ChapelLanguage), and the [How Can I Learn
Chapel?](https://chapel-lang.org/learning.html) page.
